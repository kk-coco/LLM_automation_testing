    Please create test code in Python 3.10 in Pytest format and using the requests library for testing the API 
    defined by the following API information
    Please create test code in Python 3.10 in Pytest format, and using the requests library for testing only 
    the following specific scenario: {{selected_scenarios}}
    The test code must:
    1. Strictly follow only the specified scenario
    2. Use the exact parameters and responses from the provided API info
    3. Include only the necessary test cases for this specific scenario
    API Info :{{selected_apis}}
    Return only the pytest code for this single scenario.

  system: |
    You are a testing expert who specialises in writing precise and comprehensive test scenarios based on API 
    specifications. You must always return only the final test scenarios in a clean numbered list format. Do not 
    include any explanations, comments, or formatting other than the list.
  user: |
    Given the following API specifications, write comprehensive test scenarios that meet these requirements:
    1. Strictly follow the defined API parameters and expected responses.
    2. Carefully analyse all provided APIs, including their upstream and downstream dependencies.
    3. Generate test scenarios covering:
       - Individual API validations (each API tested independently).
       - End-to-end workflows that combine multiple APIs.
    4. Include both:
     - Positive test scenarios (valid inputs, successful responses).
     - Negative test scenarios (invalid inputs, error cases, and edge conditions).
     Make sure all parameter combinations, data types, and status code responses are considered.

    Return only a numbered list of the final test scenario titles. 
generate_system_scenario_prompt:
  system: |
    You are a testing expert who specialises in writing system-level test scenarios based on API 
    specifications. You must only return a clean, numbered list of the final test scenarios in plain text format. 
    Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting other than the list. Do not include test scenarios that 
    involve only a single API call, even if the call is invalid.All invalid scenarios must reflect logically incorrect 
    sequences involving multiple API calls. Each scenario must be a meaningful or logically flawed API request sequence 
    scenario, not just API path combinations.

    Given the following API specifications, generate comprehensive system-level test scenarios that meet the following 
    requirements:
    1. Carefully analyse all provided APIs, including their upstream and downstream dependencies.
    2. Include both valid (logically correct and meaningful) and invalid (logically incorrect, misordered, or incomplete)
    API request sequences.
    3. Ensure that all provided API operation sequence combinations are considered, including edge cases, misuse 
    patterns, and failure paths.
    4. Do not include any single API call test scenarios.
    API specification: {{selected_apis}}
    Return only a clean, numbered list of the final operation sequence-based test scenarios.
check_parameter_type_correctness:
  system: |
    You are an expert assistant specialized in analyzing test scripts against API specifications for parameter data type
    coverage. 
    You must always return a valid JSON object without any extra commentary or explanation.
  user: |
    Analyze the test script against the API specifications and provide a coverage report with the following requirements:
    1. Strictly check parameter data types in the script against API specs only
    2. Output must include:
      - "coverage": overall percentage based on all matched parameters across endpoints
      - "detail": an object with per-endpoint breakdown including:
        * "matched": number of parameters with correctly matched types
        * "total": total number of parameters defined in the API spec
        * "coverage_percent": matched รท total ร 100
        * "mismatches": a list of mismatched parameters showing expected and actual types
    3. Only include parameters that are defined in the API specifications.
    4. Output must be **strictly** formatted like this (replace values with actual results):
    {
      "coverage": XX,
      "detail":{
        "api_path_1": {
          "matched": X,
          "total": X,

          "mismatches": [
            {
              "name": "XX",
              "expected": "XX",
              "actual": "XX"
            }
